# Mont Luxe Watch Company E-Commerce Platform Setup Guide

Welcome to the Mont Luxe Watch Company E-Commerce Platform. This guide will walk you through the steps to set up your development environment for both the backend (Flask) and frontend (React) components of the application.

## Preparing the Backend Environment (`server/`)
Before initializing the database, ensure you have a `.env` file set up in your `server` directory. This file will store essential environment variables for your Flask application.

### Generating the Secret Key
1. Open a terminal.
2. Generate a new secret key by running the following command:
    ```console
    python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex())'
    ```
3. Copy the output; this is your secret key.

### Creating the .env File
1. In your `server` directory, create a file named `.env`.
2. Add the following lines to the `.env` file:
    ```
    SECRET_KEY=<Your Secret Key>
    DB_URI="sqlite:///app.db"
    ```
   Replace `<Your Secret Key>` with the key you generated.

### Installing Dependencies
After cloning the project, install backend dependencies and activate the virtual environment:
```console
python3 -m venv ./
./bin/pip install pipenv
./bin/pipenv --python ./bin/python

./bin/pipenv install
./bin/pipenv shell

pip install flask_bcrypt typing_extensions

```

### Running the Flask API
To run the Flask API locally (default port 5555):
```console
python server/app.py
```

## Preparing the Frontend Environment (`client/`)
The `client/` directory contains the React frontend code.

### Installing React Dependencies
To install frontend dependencies:
```console
npm install --prefix client
```

### Starting the React App
To start the React app locally (default port 3000):
```console
npm start --prefix client
```

## Database Initialization and Seeding
After setting up your `.env` file and installing dependencies, you can initialize and seed your database. Ensure you're in the `server` directory, then run:

```sh
export FLASK_APP=app.py
export FLASK_RUN_PORT=8080

{ flask db init && echo "DB init successful"; } || echo "DB init failed, continuing..."
{ flask db migrate -m "initial migration" && echo "DB migrate successful"; } || echo "DB migrate failed, continuing..."
{ flask db upgrade head && echo "DB upgrade successful"; } || echo "DB upgrade failed, continuing..."
{ python seed.py && echo "Seeding successful"; } || echo "Seeding failed"
```

These commands will initialize the database, perform migrations, upgrade to the latest version, and seed it with initial data. After this you should see it on your http://localhost:3000/ enjoy! ☺️
